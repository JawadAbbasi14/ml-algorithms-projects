# 🚧 In Progress: Machine Learning Algorithms Project

This project is being developed step-by-step by following my personal roadmap:
🎯 [The Ultimate Algorithm Blueprint](https://jawadabbasi14.github.io/the-ultimate-algorithm-blueprint/)

## 📘 About This Repository

This repository contains clean implementations of essential machine learning algorithms in Python with code, visualizations, and use-case examples. It is designed to help deeply understand each algorithm through plotting, real data, and theory.

Each algorithm is isolated into its own folder with:
- ✅ Core Python code
- 📊 Matplotlib-based visualizations
- 🧠 Markdown notes explaining the concept and usage
