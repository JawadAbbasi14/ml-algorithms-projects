# ✅ Linear Regression

This folder contains the full implementation of **Linear Regression** as part of the [Ultimate Algorithm Blueprint](https://jawadabbasi14.github.io/the-ultimate-algorithm-blueprint/). It includes a basic example of predicting outcomes using a linear relationship and visualizing the best-fit line.

---

## 📌 Overview

Linear Regression is a foundational **supervised learning** algorithm that finds the best-fitting straight line (Y = mX + c) to predict continuous outcomes based on input features.
