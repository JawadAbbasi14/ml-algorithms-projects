# 🚀 KNN Algorithm – Career Path Prediction  
📌 Status: 🚧 In Progress  
🧠 Part of: [My AI Algorithm Roadmap](https://jawadabbasi14.github.io/the-ultimate-algorithm-blueprint/)

This project implements the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to predict a student's career path based on their subject marks.  
It is part of a larger AI learning roadmap and includes:

- ✅ Core logic implementation
- 📈 Visualized plots
- 🧪 Real-world use-case: Career Path Suggestion
