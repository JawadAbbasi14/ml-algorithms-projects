# 🚀 Student Career Predictor System 🎓

📍 **Status:** In Progress  
📚 **Built by following my personal roadmap:** [The Ultimate Algorithm Blueprint](https://jawadabbasi14.github.io/the-ultimate-algorithm-blueprint/)

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This project predicts a student’s:
- 📈 **Expected Salary** using **Linear Regression**
- ✅ **Job Readiness** using **Logistic Regression**
- 🎯 **Career Path Suggestion** using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

All models are trained on academic marks, internship status, and career outcomes to simulate a real-world prediction system.
