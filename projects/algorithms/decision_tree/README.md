Decision Tree Implementation
Overview
This project provides a Python implementation of a Decision Tree algorithm for classification tasks. It includes functionality for training, testing, and visualizing decision trees, suitable for both educational purposes and practical machine learning applications.
Features

Custom Decision Tree Classifier: Implements a decision tree from scratch with support for Gini impurity and Information Gain splitting criteria.
Visualization: Generates visual representations of the decision tree using Graphviz.
Preprocessing: Includes utilities for data preprocessing, such as handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Evaluation: Provides metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model evaluation.
Sample Dataset: Includes a sample dataset for quick testing and experimentation.

Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or higher
Required Python libraries:
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn (for comparison and preprocessing)
graphviz (for visualization)
pydotplus (for rendering decision tree graphs)



Install dependencies using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/decision-tree.git
cd decision-tree


Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


(Optional) Install Graphviz for visualization:

On Windows: Download and install from Graphviz website.
On macOS: brew install graphviz
On Linux: sudo apt-get install graphviz



Usage

Prepare Your Data:

Place your dataset in the data/ folder or use the provided sample_dataset.csv.
Ensure the dataset is in CSV format with features and a target column.


Run the Decision Tree:

To train and test the decision tree, run:
python main.py


This will:

Load the dataset.
Train the decision tree model.
Evaluate performance on the test set.
Generate a visualization of the tree (saved as tree.png).




Customize Parameters:

Modify config.json to adjust hyperparameters like:
max_depth: Maximum depth of the tree.
min_samples_split: Minimum samples required to split a node.
criterion: Splitting criterion (gini or entropy).




Example Output:
Accuracy: 0.85
Precision: 0.82
Recall: 0.87
F1-Score: 0.84

Example Dataset
The included sample_dataset.csv contains a synthetic dataset with features like age, income, and credit_score, and a binary target variable approved. You can replace it with your own dataset, ensuring it follows a similar structure.
Visualization
The decision tree is visualized as a PNG file (tree.png) using Graphviz. To view the tree, ensure Graphviz is installed and added to your system PATH.
