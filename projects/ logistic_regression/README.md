# ✅ Logistic Regression 

This folder contains the complete implementation of **Logistic Regression** as part of the [Ultimate Algorithm Blueprint](https://jawadabbasi14.github.io/the-ultimate-algorithm-blueprint/). It includes data preparation, model training, and a clear probability plot to visualize the logistic function in action.

---

## 📌 Overview

Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for **binary classification problems**. It models the **probability** that a given input belongs to a particular class using the sigmoid function.
